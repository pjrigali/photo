## Disposable Camera Effect

The `disposable_camera.ipynb` notebook gives your digital images a nostalgic, disposable camera look.

### Features
*   **High ISO Noise/Grain**: Simulates the grainy texture of film.
*   **Soft Focus**: Adds a subtle blur characteristic of cheap plastic lenses.
*   **Color Grading**: Applies warm tones, faded colors, and specific color shifts (green/yellow/blue).
*   **Vintage Curves**: Flattens highlights and lifts shadows for a faded look.
*   **Vignetting**: Adds darker corners.
*   **Aspect Ratio**: Automatically crops to 4x6 or 6x4.

### Usage
Open the notebook and configure the `IMAGE_PATH` and `OUTPUT_FOLDER` in the "Configuration" section to process your images.
